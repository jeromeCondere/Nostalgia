## What is Nostalgia ?

Nostalgia is a project that provide tools in order to program SMA which mean multi agent system, SMA are often use in distributed 
artificial intelligence system or distributed computing system.  
Indeed a SMA is a platform that provide tools for asynchronous communication,the atoms of such systems are called 
agents and it is very important to set a definition of this concept. An agent is a computional entity that is
autonomous and that interact with its environment which can be the OS or other agents or even physical environnement
and is this case we can talk of autonomous sensor.  
We use *Jade* (http://jade.tilab.com/)  which is framework implemented in java that help us to implement a SMA for the Nostalgia project.

###the main goal

The main goal of Nostalgia is to provide tools for multi modeling in order to develop multi modeling systems easier.
Multi modeling can be very useful because it consist to interact several agents called model agents that run programs
called model in order to simulate collective phenomena.The main purpose of creating multi modeling system is to study
the influence of a set of models over one or several models.  
Nostalgia use is specialized on multi modeling based on *Netlogo* (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)

### other goal

Another goal of nostalgia is to implement tool for DAI (distributed artificial intelligence) especially with
neural networks.
