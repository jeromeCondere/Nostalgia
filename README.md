## What is Nostalgia ?

Nostalgia is a project that provides tools in order to program MAS which mean multi agent system, MAS are often used in distributed 
artificial intelligence system or distributed computing system.  
Indeed an MAS is a platform that provides tools for asynchronous communication, the atoms of such systems are called 
agents and it is very important to give a definition of this concept. An agent is a computional entity that is
autonomous and that interacts with its environment which can be the OS or other agents or even physical environnement
. In that case we can call them autonomous sensor.  
We use *Jade* (http://jade.tilab.com/)  which is framework implemented in java that helps us to implement a MAS for the Nostalgia project.

###the main goal

The main goal of Nostalgia is to provide tools for multi modeling in order to develop multi modeling systems easier.
Multi modeling can be very useful because it consists in letting several agents called model agents interact. They run programs
called models in order to simulate collective phenomena. The main purpose of creating multi modeling systems is to study
the influence of a set of models over one or several models.  
Nostalgia use is specialized on multi modeling based on *Netlogo* (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)

### other goal

Another goal of nostalgia is to implement tools for DAI (distributed artificial intelligence) especially with
neural networks.
